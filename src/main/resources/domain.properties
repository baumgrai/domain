# 'Data horizon' is a relative date the past. Objects of @useDataHorizon annotated object domain classes which last modification before 'data horizon' will be treated as 'old' 
# and will not be loaded from database into object store initially (but if they are referenced by other non-data-horizon-controlled objects)
# En/decryption password must be configured if data shall be encrypted before storing in database (@Crypt annotation for fields). 'salt' used for generating crypt key may be configured too 

# for unit tests only
